### Entering and leaving vi
- vi file edits existing or new file
- [Shift] + ZZ writes file and quits (or :wq[Return] )
- :q![Return] quits without saving changes (or [Shift] + ZQ)

### Buffer Management
```vim
:buffers "list open buffers
:ls "list open buffers
:list buffers "list open buffers
:b [TAB] "to cycle through buffers
:bp "previous buffer
:bn "next buffer
:bd "to delete contents in current buffer

:-1r <file name> "Read file to line before
:e "to open a file
:e . " ls of the current directory
:e! " back to last saved

3j6w "this will move 3 lines down and 6 words to left
- (minus) "goes to the beginning of the previous line
1G or gg(lower case) "i.e 1+shift+g # first line of the file
G "i.e shift+g # last line of the file
% " % All lines (same as 1,$)
ctrl+f " page down
ctrl+b "page up

```vim
m<character>
mx "set a mark called x 
```
